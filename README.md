## What is Varnish?

[Varnish Cache](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.

## How to use this image.

This image is intended as a base image for other images to built on.

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your Varnish project

```dockerfile
FROM texastribune/varnish:5.1.1
```

### Create a `default.vcl` in your Varnish project

```vcl
vcl 4.0;

backend default {
    .host = "www.nytimes.com";
    .port = "80";
}
```

Then, run the commands to build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-varnish .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-varnish my-varnish
```

### Customize configuration

You can override the port Varnish serves in your Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
FROM texastribune/varnish:5.1.1

ENV VARNISH_PORT 8080
ENV VARNISH_DAEMON_OPTS "additional varnish options here"
EXPOSE 8080
```

For valid VARNISH_DAEMON_OPTS, see the [varnish options documentation](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/5.0/reference/varnishd.html#options).



You can override the size of the cache.

```dockerfile
FROM texastribune/varnish:5.1.1

ENV VARNISH_MEMORY 1G
```

## How to install VMODs (Varnish Modules)

[Varnish Modules](https://www.varnish-cache.org/vmods) are extensions written for Varnish Cache.

To install Varnish Modules, you will need the Varnish source to compile against. This is why we install Varnish from source in this image rather than using a package manager.

Install VMODs in your Varnish project's Dockerfile. For example, to install the Querystring module:

```dockerfile
FROM texastribune/varnish:5.1.1

# Install Querystring Varnish module
ENV QUERYSTRING_VERSION=0.3
RUN \
  cd /usr/local/src/ && \
  curl -sfL https://github.com/Dridi/libvmod-querystring/archive/v$QUERYSTRING_VERSION.tar.gz -o libvmod-querystring-$QUERYSTRING_VERSION.tar.gz && \
  tar -xzf libvmod-querystring-$QUERYSTRING_VERSION.tar.gz && \
  cd libvmod-querystring-$QUERYSTRING_VERSION && \
  ./autogen.sh && \
  ./configure VARNISHSRC=/usr/local/src/varnish-$VARNISH_VERSION && \
  make install && \
  rm -r ../libvmod-querystring-$QUERYSTRING_VERSION*
```
